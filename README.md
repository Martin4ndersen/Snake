# Snake üêç

A classic Snake game built with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), featuring pixel art assets from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/snake-game-assets).

This project was created to explore the new [TileMapLayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/classes/class_tilemaplayer.html) node and experiment with [exporting for the web](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html). 
Due to an [issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70796) with web export for C#, the game is implemented using GDScript.
