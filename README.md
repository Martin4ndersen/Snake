# Snake üêç

A classic Snake game built with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), featuring pixel art assets from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/snake-game-assets).

The project was created to explore the new [TileMapLayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/classes/class_tilemaplayer.html) node introduced in Godot 4.3 and experiment with [exporting for the web](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html). Due to an [issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70796) with web export for C#, the game is implemented using GDScript. You can play the game on [itch.io](https://martin4ndersen.itch.io/snake).
